System A prediction (Person predictions are in Blue)

Tom and Jerry was the best cartoon on in Paris. No one watched more than Joe and Bob

 

Correct Answer

Tom and Jerry was the best cartoon on in Paris. No one watched more than Joe and Bob




What is the accuracy of System A?
What is the precision of System A?
What is the recall of System A?
What is the F1-Measure of System A?
Which measure do you think represents the true value of the system, and why?
 



program a functions that calculates and displays all 4 metrics (accuracy,precision, recall,f-measure) . The functions should accept TP,TN,FP,FN and spit out the results
